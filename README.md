## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SelStefan/radio-ascii.git
cd radio-ascii
npm install
```

## Usage

#####  Development server
Run ```npm start``` in the base project folder for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##### Giving a path to an audio source
If you have started the development server and pushed the large play â–º button, and no music started coming out, don't panic, the case is probably that you just didn't set a path to an audio source in the url.
To set an audio source path, in the adress bar of your browser append ```/src/<your audio address>``` and press enter to navigate to the new url.
For example you can copy one of the audio address from http://dir.xiph.org/index.php and append it after ```src/``` in you your url: http://localhost:3000/src/http://secure.live-streams.nl/opus.opus
Now, after your navigate to the new url with the audio adress set, you can press the play button to watch the ascii waveform visualizations.

##### Build
Run ```npm run build``` to build the project. The static build artifacts will be stored in the build/ directory.

## Todo
* Optimize the ascii drawing algorithm
* Make the audio source selection more user friendly
* Add UI for ascii waveform manipulation
